<br />A) Enformat Enginyers' commitment to privacy

<br />This website is administered by Enformat Enginyers, S.L. ("Enformat Enginyers" or "we"). Enformat Enginyers wants you to feel secure when visiting our website or using our services, and is committed to maintaining your privacy. This Privacy Policy applies to data collected by Enformat Enginyers through its website www.enformat.cat or by other means during the course of its business. Please read this Enformat Enginyers Privacy Policy very carefully.
<br />
<br />B) Why Enformat Enginyers collects personal information

<br />During the course of carrying out our business and performing our services, Enformat Enginyers collect personal information in order to conduct our business, to provide and market our services, and to meet our legal obligations. Sometimes, our clients may also require us to collect information on their behalf in connection with their services or products to you. We may also collect data for other purposes, which we would describe in more detail to you at the point we collect the information.
<br />
<br />You may refuse to provide us with some or all of your personal information; however, this may limit the ways in which we can interact with you, including providing you with our services.
<br />
<br />C) The kinds of information we collect

<br />We usually collect the following kinds of personal information:

<br />Name, address, occupation, and contact information (if it is for IT project research purposes, we may anonymise the information upon your request if it is practical to do so);
Interests in our services or events, or that of our clients;
Information about people's dealings with us or our clients; and
Your opinion or comments on certain matters (e.g., process, systems and IT services).
<br /><br />D) How information is collected

<br />Enformat Enginyers gathers information in two ways:

<br />Indirectly (through our site's technology or through other third parties who collect information on our behalf or have the right to share your information with us); and
Directly (when you provide information to us by way of paper or online forms or questionnaires filled out by you, face-to-face meetings, interviews, business cards or telephone conversations).
One example of information we collect indirectly is information collected through our Internet access logs. When you access our website, your Internet address is automatically collected and is placed in our Internet access logs. We may also record the URLs of the websites and pages you visit (before, during and after your visit to any Enformat Enginyers website), the times and dates of such visits, information about the computer hardware and software you use and other information that may be available.
<br />
<br />Additionally, we may collect information from you through the use of cookies. Cookies and their use on our website are explained in greater detail in the Tracking Technologies section in this policy.

<br />We also collect information directly when you voluntarily provide it to us. For example, we may provide the opportunity to sign up for a periodic email newsletter by entering your email address. It is completely up to you whether or not you want to provide it. Additionally, we collect personal information when you apply online for a job opening at Enformat Enginyers.
<br />
<br />E) How does Enformat Enginyers use this information?

<br />We hold, use and may disclose your personal information for the purposes as set out in this Privacy Policy or as otherwise disclosed at the time of collection. We generally use and disclose your personal information for the following purposes:
<br />
<br />to provide our services to you or our clients
<br />to manage our relationships with you or our clients
<br />to improve Enformat Enginyers or its client's services
<br />to provide professional advice to our clients relating to the performance of IT system and procedures
<br />to review and assess your job applications
<br />to answer your inquiry
<br />to direct-market products and services, advise you of news and industry updates, trends and events
<br />to share with trusted third parties (e.g., our contracted service providers or advisers) whom we have engaged to provide services to you or help us meet our contractual or legal obligations. 
<br />
<br />F) Sending information overseas and sharing information with other parties

<br />Information that we collect may be stored and processed in and transferred between any of the countries in which Enformat Enginyers, its respective partners, affiliates or contractors, have offices in order to enable Enformat Enginyers to use the information as set out in this Privacy Policy. By submitting your information to Enformat Enginyers website or any of our products or services, you expressly agree to such transfer in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
<br />
<br />We will respect and protect your privacy as set out in this Privacy Policy. We will share your personal information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this privacy policy. And won't sell individual information. You agree Enformat Enginyers may share your personal information with non-Enformat Enginyers parties with your consent (express, constructive of implied), or as required by law such as to comply with subpoena, bankruptcy proceedings, or similar legal process when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect Enformat Enginyers, its customers, the public, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request. You agree that Enformat Enginyers may share your personal information with organizations or persons that help us fulfill our obligations or provide our services to you.

<br />
<br />We reserve the right to disclose any information that we obtain through any Enformat Enginyers website to appropriate governmental or regulatory authorities, if required by law or any governmental agency.
<br />
<br />If Enformat Enginyers is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, we may need to share your personal information with the acquiring entity. In that event you will be notified via a notice on our website of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information.
<br />
<br />Frames

<br />
<br />G) How does Enformat Enginyers protect sensitive personal information?

<br />Other than the information you provide when you apply for an employment position at Enformat Enginyers, we do not generally seek to collect sensitive personal information through this site. Therefore, we advise you not to provide any unsolicited sensitive personal information. By providing us with unsolicited sensitive personal information, you consent to our use of the information for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy, subject to applicable law. Enformat Enginyers usually applies HTTPS or other technical measure to secure the personal information transmitted over its website.
